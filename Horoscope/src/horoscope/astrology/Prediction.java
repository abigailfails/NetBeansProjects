            "Murphy’s Law seems to be the rule of the day.\nWhen everything is under control in one area, little things demand attention in another today.\nAlthough you might wish differently, the simple fact is impermanence is a featured quality of most human endeavors while perpetual harmony only works out beautifully in dreams.\nFortunately, your multitasking skills are up to the task now.\nLoved ones and workmates suspect that you secretly thrive on the hustle and bustle.\nIt is fun to keep them guessing about whether they are right.\nYour infectious energy is your weapon of choice.\n",
            "You may often play the strong and silent type, rarely gushing over your feelings unless it’s warranted.\nInstead, you bring mature focus to emotions and a responsible brand of purpose to your helpfulness.\nYour pragmatic approach puts you in the catbird seat when it comes to showing another person that you care today.\nDrive the carpool, buy the coffee, or field a tough phone call on their behalf.\nThere are countless practical ways to express what is in your heart.\nYour authenticity speaks volumes when your actions are on point.\n",
            "Corralling stray thoughts can be a lot like trying to herd cats today.\nWith a special event or deadline looming ever nearer, you sense that the most headway can be made by concentrating on one priority at a time.\nBut maintaining this mental focus is easier said than done when there is so much of interest going on around you.\nHave patience with your wandering mind and give your thoughts a chance to crystallize on their own volition.\nLike a feline, inspiration has an uncanny knack for finding its way home.\n",
            "Intuition enters the picture as the practical voice of reason that plays at the back of your mind.\nInstinctive responses are cautious today, especially when you are working your way through matters of money, business, or commerce.\nThere are benefits to a slow and steady approach, not the least of which might be less stress or increased prosperity.\nIf you rush or fuss, you risk overlooking an important detail.\nThankfully, even a large mountain can be moved one small stone at a time.\n",
            "You have so many better things to do than jump through hoops just to make someone happy.\nHowever, it is only natural to wish to want to please those you admire.\nBut if contortion is required to fit in, it is a huge red flag that the crowd you are trying to join is not the right one for you.\nYou are a strong, proud individual -- your own person through and through.\nChanging so others will appreciate you is like driving on a tire that has an invisible leak.\nSooner or later, it is going to go flat.\nYour true vibe attracts your genuine tribe.\n",
            "Your eagle eye works like a charm today.\nA cornerstone of your originality is your ability to spot the creative possibilities in activities or items that most others see as strictly utilitarian.\nDon’t be distracted by those who question why or how you could be so intrigued by what they consider mundane.\nThe proof is in the pudding and your results consistently exceed even your own very high standards, especially in areas of health, hygiene, and science.\nAuthor Jeffrey Fry wrote, ‘Only those who can see the invisible can do the impossible.\n’",
            "Step into a leadership role with surety, and you can designate, delegate, and guide with confidence.\nWhether the job at hand looks to be a thrill a minute or is basically a series of yawns, you realize that accomplishment is about far more than excitement or boredom.\nYour instinctual understanding of the deeper significance of today’s itinerary throws a lot of responsibility in your direction.\nTake charge of your own positive attitude and others are inspired to see things your way.\nWithout hard work, nothing grows but weeds.\n",
            "Take a deep breath and prepare to share whatever crosses your mind.\nBegin a conversation, make a sales pitch, compose an editorial, or create art.\nYour thoughts and feelings flow almost as if moving through a funnel today, empowering you to concentrate with laser-like precision.\nThe results might include a surprising realization or two, some profound insights, and a whole lot of emotions you need to get off your chest.\nFinding the right outlet for all of your intensity is the real trick.\nAuthor Pearl Buck wrote, ‘Self-expression must pass into communication for its fulfillment.\n’",
            "Advance on all fronts, but do so carefully and mindfully today.\nHints and clues trace a path forward; simultaneously, signal lights flash to warn you away from pitfalls like excess.\nBe deliberate about every footfall and you can successfully broaden your range of influence or multiply the scope of realistic options on your menu.\nYou may not be able to snap your fingers and immediately make what you wish for appear.\nBut thankfully, little by little, you can inch closer to it.\nProgress isn’t measured by a straight line.\n",
            "You can thrive when in the public eye today.\nYour social skills are so in the groove that you may sail through any engagement almost exclusively by virtue of your charm alone.\nIf you want to assume a higher profile within a group, club, or organization, the ideal opportunity to state your case could arise.\nOthers are exceptionally receptive to your message now.\nAnd, with the gentlest of nudges, many seem ready to offer abundant encouragement and support.\nSoak up the vitality of a caring community spirit while you can.\nPaying the kindness forward is an absolute pleasure.\n",
            "Evolution is a necessary part of growth.\nYou might find it cringeworthy if the sole-stated reason for a person or company favoring one method over another is because of tradition.\nYou can be so progressive in your thinking that it is difficult to muster up much patience for stalwart adherence to the status quo.\nHowever, small changes made in delicate increments could be the least disruptive way to proceed when an update is required.\nA little of this, a little of that, and all of a sudden, innovation is knocking at your door.\nA perfect mix of the old and the new cultivates a creative environment.\n",
            "A surprise can really do a number on your preconceptions today.\nAnd as unnerving as an unexpected event might be, it’s also a kind of awakening when you are open to learning on the fly.\nThis could be a cosmic reminder that the whole of your everyday routine adds up to more than merely the sum of its various parts.\nNot every experience fits conveniently into a neat compartment and if it did, boredom would quickly descend.\nThankfully, you can be in the present without struggling to define it.\nPoet Omar Khayyam said, ‘Be happy for this moment.\nThis moment is your life.\n’"
